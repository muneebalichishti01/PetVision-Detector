# PetVision-Detector
PetVision is a deep learning project that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Built with TensorFlow, this project demonstrates application of image preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation with additional insights into model's decision-making process through feature map visuals.
